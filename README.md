# 42lisboa

This repository showcases my coding journey at 42 Lisboa, an innovative developer school situated in Portugal and affiliated with the global 42 network. With 54 campuses spanning 31 countries worldwide, the 42 network is renowned for its unique pedagogy, emphasizing peer-to-peer learning, hands-on projects, and fostering a collaborative and inclusive coding community.

As you explore this repository, you'll find the culmination of my various coding projects as part of the 42 curriculum.

## Contents of the Repository

1. **Piscine**

    *Experience:* The Piscine was my initiation into the School 42 journey, an intensive 1-month coding bootcamp designed to assess and develop programming skills. I started with 0 coding experience.

2. **libft**

     *Objective:* In the libft project, I crafted my own C library, a collection of essential functions. This was not just about coding; it was about understanding the intricacies of C, memory management, and data structures. My libft became a toolkit that I carried throughout my entire curriculum.

3. **ft_printf**

    *Challenge:* I had to reimplement the printf function. This meant diving deep into string formatting, variable arguments, and precision handling.

5. **get_next_line**

    *Application:* The get_next_line project refined my ability to read and handle input from files or standard input. I learned to manage buffers, handle edge cases, and create a robust function for reading lines.

6. **push_swap**

    *Algorithm Mastery:* Push_swap was a standout challenge that tasked me with designing an efficient algorithm to sort a stack of integers. Minimizing the number of moves became a puzzle, and the project strengthened my algorithmic thinking and optimization skills.
