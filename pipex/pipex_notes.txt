CODING PROCESS:

NEW FUNCTIONS: dup, dup2, execve, fork, pipe, unlink, wait, waitpid

int dup(int oldfd); // returns a newfd which is the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor for the new descriptor
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd); // returns a newfd which in the 2nd param

int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
const char *pathname = program
char *const argv[] = ponters to strings passes to the new program
char *const envp[] = strings passed as the environment of the new program

pid_t fork(void);
fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is referred to as
the child process. The calling process is referred to as the parent process.
On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.
On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, and errno is  set  appropriately.
